# Pi Piper Design Overview

### The Problem
>
> Since its conception Republic Pi has used a paper prep list and a company ipad to make its orders between the two top services in the area, Sysco and US Foods. In the past,
> the manager making the orders has had to juggle multiple devices in order to compare prices to make the most effective order per the restauraunts needs.

### My Solution
>
> Create an ipad app that digitizes and automates the Prep List and Order Management system. This project will display all comparisons and be able to formulate the orders for the
> manager while comparing. Offering suggestions and presets along the way in order to save the user time. Alongside this service will be a digitized prep list and planning
> visualization for pre-open and pre-rush.
